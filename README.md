# RoxyTap

## Introduction

RoxyTap is a non-commercial clicker game, inspired by the OG clicker games and modern tap-to-earn projects. This game is my first proper practise with such game format, this is not meant to be a commercial project, as it uses assets that aren't mine. All the assets, including backgrounds, coin/button images and music belong to [@SteelWoolStudio](https://x.com/SteelWoolStudio) and Scott Cawthon

The game can be broken down into 5 main pages:
- Title screen
- Home page
- Socials page
- Shop
- Share page

## Overview and gameplay 

### Title screen

A simple title screen with some animations that greets players every time they open the game

### Home page

The main page where the gameplay begins. Here you can tap on the main coin/button to earn points, which you can later spend in the shop for boosters and cosmetics. 
In addition in the top left corner there's a player's nickname, which player can type in after leaving tittle screen during first launch of the game.
There are 3 buttons on the home page, which player can interact with:
- Music button (turns the music on and off)
- Vibration switch (turns the vibration on and off)
- Coin selection button (prompts a small menu where player can select one of the purchased coins/buttons)

On the bottom of the screen there's a navbar, allowing to navigate through 4 main pages

Another simple page that has one button to copy the link to the game and later can be sent to others 


## Known issues (WIP)

The project is still in the early stage of development with big changes coming up. One of the few things that I'm already working on is:
- Design and technical issues with login screen
- Localization support
- Pages looking cropped and cramped on smaller devices


## Future plans

Amongst things I want to add in future (which will be followed by this readme's update) are:
- Shop expansions
- Stacking system
- Mini games
- SQL database support
- Extended customization of Home page
